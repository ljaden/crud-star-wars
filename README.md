# Star Wars Quotes
Built with Express, Node, and MongoDb this simple web application executes CRUD operations sprinkled with a Star Wars theme.

User can create a quote and submit it to be stored in the database. This quote will also be displayed under 'Quotes'. There are also 2 buttons on the page that allows users to interact with the web application. Instructions are stated above the respective buttions.

# Lessons learned
By creating this application i understood the process of creating a RESTful api and interacting with it. Executing the CRUD operations taught me how the client and servers send and recieve data.
